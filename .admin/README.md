This directory is used to keep 'admin' files used to update/manage this repository.

The header.md is used as the header before the list of adventuress in the main directory's README.md file. update_adventures.sh is used to update the list of adventuress from the wiki page.

For now, these files need to be copied to the main directory and a 'wiki.wiki' directory needs to exist in the parent directory and needs to be updated. The script should in the future manage its own git clone of the wiki and keep it up to date on its own.
